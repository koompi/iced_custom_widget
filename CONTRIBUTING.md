## Purpose
This paper summarises rules that have been defined by the KOOMPI team for all the contributors. The purpose of this paper is to share and help all the contributors understand all the protocols clearly. Any violation of the protocols will result in rejection of the work submitted. 

This paper was compiled by the KOOMPI team to summarize rules for all contributors of KOOMPI. 

### Rules
These are the rules that all contributors must follow:

### Projects
All projects on our GitHub are public and provide complete instructions, so you may feel free to clone and fork it as youâ€™d like. The projects will be updated (pushed frequently by our team), therefore, you must also pull requests (PR) accordingly.

If you are interested in our project and you want to propose something new, you can do either of the following:
1. clone the project, work on it, then propose 
1. propose to us and make it happen after a discussion
1. the contributors must follow the coding language of each project

### Reporting Bugs
Before you create an issue, please make sure you have checked out relevant documents (reports) or messages on the last git push and tracking issues section. It is pretty common that other contributors or someone from our team have already reported or fixed it.

If you have checked and you do not see any reports or messages, you can create or issue a bug report in the issue section.

### Tracking Issues
All the issues that have been discovered can be found in the issues tracker.

### Requested Features
New features are welcome. However, you have to make sure the feature fits the project. If it meets our scope, please provide as many details as possible.

### Creating Branch 
We recommend every contributor to create their own branch. This will make it easier for both sides to organize the work. After you finish, you can issue a merging request to the master branch (MB). You have to make sure to include necessary information about it while you are creating the merging request.

### Pull Requesting
Pull request here refers to the merging request.

We prefer small pull requests (PR) with minimal code change because the smaller the pull requests (PRs), the easier our team can review the merge. 

Reviewing will be started as soon as possible. However, this process may take some time. Your request may sometimes be rejected or small changes may be required. 

### Organizing
Sorting, categorizing, and moving articles around have become a major task for the team. Please make sure you create a new file with the exact feature name. 

### Complaining
If you have any feedback or complaints about the existing feature, please leave a message  through our issue section.

### Maintainer
Each project has maintainers whose role is to organize, maintain, and overlook each project. When there are issues, the maintainers will notify the relevant team through the Github project issue board. Therefore, if you have any issues and you want to contact the team, the maintainer would be the first guy you must contact. 

On each project, there will be a list of maintainers.

### KOOMPI 
Please note that all projects are released within the KOOMPI organization. By participating in the projects, you agree to abide by our terms and conditions.
